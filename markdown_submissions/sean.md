## About Me

I am an avid programmer interested in learning as much as possible
about the field of software engineering. You can often find me
exploring new and upcoming tools, languages and frameworks, while
at the same time deepening my knowledge in those that I have already
learnt. I am currently working with 5 of my friends, working on
projects together that will benefit the community.

## Relevant Skills

1.  Backend Web Development with [Go](https://golang.org)
2.  App Development with [Swift](https://swift.org)
3.  Frontend Web Development with HTML, CSS and JavaScript

Colons can be used to align columns.

| Tables        |      Are      |  Cool |
| ------------- | :-----------: | ----: |
| col 3 is      | right-aligned | $1600 |
| col 2 is      |   centered    |   $12 |
| zebra stripes |   are neat    |    $1 |

There must be at least 3 dashes separating each header cell.
The outer pipes (|) are optional, and you don't need to make the
raw Markdown line up prettily. You can also use inline Markdown.

| Markdown | Less      | Pretty     |
| -------- | --------- | ---------- |
| _Still_  | `renders` | **nicely** |
| 1        | 2         | 3          |
